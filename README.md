# youkumetadatascraper
Scraper for uploader, upload date, original url, and description for Youku videos. Written in Python 2. I'm a beginner so this is nothing too advanced or special.

To use:

python youkuscr.py

and then type the identifier when prompted. The results will be displayed on-screen and outputted into a text-file.
